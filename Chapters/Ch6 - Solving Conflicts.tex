\chapter{Solving Conflicts}
\chapteroverlay

A merge conflict happens when you have competing commits. For example, you change something and want to merge it but someone else has made a different commit and your branch or code isn't up-to-date. 
\nln Often, merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.

\section{Visual Studio}
In Visual Studio you need to go to the Git Changes window and from there you should see Merge Conflicts

using the editor you can then resolve these conflicts.

Once you have resolved them you can close VS and then stage and commit all your changes.
